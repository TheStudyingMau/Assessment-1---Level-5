# Assessment 1 Responsive Web Development
This repository consists of my accomplishments of the challenges given by my assessments Regarding responsive Web Designing. I did my best on replicating the layout of the requirements while also maintaining the required specifications such as spacing, sizing, and etc.

# Brief Synopsis
We were taught on how to improve our websites having it respond to different screen resolutions. It can either be resizing elements or a completely different layout. We absorbed the teaching material by exercising it through two tasks:

**Folder 1 - Task 1: Responsive Layout and Typography**<br>
**Folder 2 - Task 2: Advanced Layout**

## Task 1 - Responsive Layout and Typography
Our first task is to create the website for a blog post about the Erased Tapes Records music label. We didn't have creative liberty as we had to meet the wireframe mock-ups for layout and the written specifications. 

While meeting the requirements, we're also required to make it responsive to different screen sizes through media query. Assets and specific dimensions were thankfully provided for use.

## Task 2 - Advanced Layout
Our second task is to create the website for 'watch.it', a made-up movie streaming service. Similar to the first, we had to meet wireframe mock-ups for layout and written specifications.

Assets were also provided in a separate folder. However, there's a bit more creative liberty in task 2 as we are required to make careful appropriate design decisions to implement specific details. We were also required to make use of media queries.


# Personal Thoughts

Task 1 was challenging, but also beneficial for me to know the tools I can do in CSS to maximize my website building skills. I learned the use of grid through on-going lectures and through my colleagues, learned the use of "column-count" to adjust the amount of columns texts cover in a container.

From previous web designing tasks, I learned how to manage my code in a neat way by making separate files for its certain purposes so that it should be easier to manage.

Task 2 seemed to be familiar, but served as a challenge when it comes to images and meeting the requirements. Though it's not too perfect, I learned how useful "grid" can be as a display rather than "flex" for responsiveness of the web and meeting a specific layout.

I also learned the use and efficiency of semantics as using "div" all the time became a bad coding habit. This goes the same to using "div" for images.
